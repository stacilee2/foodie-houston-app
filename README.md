# Foodie. (Houston Edition)

This application was created for the targeted "foodie" user, who wants to go beyond the Yelp review to find new acclaimed restaurants in Houston. The user can create an account with a secured password and login when reservations are made. The user will be able to see a restaurant card with the image, cuisine, and description of the restaurant and will be able to make a reservation for that restaurant. The reservations are made available through a dropdown menu and can be updated or deleted through a reservation form.
